      What are the best practices associated with using Classes vs. IDs?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Classes are used for styling multiple tags all at once whereas IDs are
      used for only once for one specific thing. An example of class use is like
      when people are grouped as having the same identity in a certain race such
      as "all asians have black hair". However, IDs are used as the individual
      traits that each person has which is unique to them such as one person
      might like spicy food and another person likes anime. IDs are only used
      for individual, unique situations.

      blog to the middle of the page.
