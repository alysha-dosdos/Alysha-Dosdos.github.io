    <h4>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h4>
    It is the ability to understand yourself and others, their feelings and
    their emotion. Being able to make decisions based off this knowledge about
    people is emotional intelligence.
    <h4>How is EQ different to IQ?</h4>
    EQ is about the knowledge of people in relationships and how humans react to
    things whereas IQ is about the mental capabilities to deal with complex
    problems about the world as a whole.
    <h4>Why is EQ important?</h4>
    It is important to build and maintain relationships with others and
    yourself, to understand and communicate any difficulties. Without EQ, it
    will be hard to deal with complex problems with troubling emotions.
