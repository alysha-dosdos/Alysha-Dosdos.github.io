    <h4>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h4>
    It is the ability to understand yourself and others, their feelings and
    their emotion. Being able to make decisions based off this knowledge about
    people is emotional intelligence. It is the ability to be aware of how
    you're feeling and how to manage those feelings so that we don't act on our
    emotions and stay calm in any situation. The same goes when it comes to how
    others are feeling and being able to help or communicate and defuse any
    situation is important in any social setting.
    <h4>How is EQ different to IQ?</h4>
    EQ is about the knowledge of people in relationships and how humans react to
    things whereas IQ is about the mental capabilities to deal with complex
    problems about the world as a whole. IQ is mostly the knowledge within
    ourselves and how we solve problems logically whereas EQ is the knowledge
    about managing emotions and how we can understand our own and other's
    feelings.
    <h4>Why is EQ important?</h4>
    It is important to build and maintain relationships with others and
    yourself, to understand and communicate any difficulties. Without EQ, it
    will be hard to deal with complex problems with troubling emotions. When we
    speak out with anger, we don't end up seeing the logic or see the other
    side's perspective which is important when it comes to solving an issue with
    someone else. This is why having the ability to self regulate and also
    empathize with someone else can help build relationships with others which
    allows us to work with anyone in a team, especially in tech.
