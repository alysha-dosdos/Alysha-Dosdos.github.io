    <h2>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h2>
    <h4>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h4>
    I'm still hoping to work towards a managerial role in the tech industry. I'm
    hoping to get more programming skills as well as people skills to help
    manage my team.

    <h4>
      What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
      Bootcamp?
    </h4>
    I think it's still the same as last time. I still have to keep working on my
    mindset and be more forgiving to myself when I dont know things yet. I also
    need to find the perfect balance with coding, doing chores, work, cooking
    and socializing. As well as finding time to meditate and even exercise. Once
    I figure it all out, I will be unstoppable in bootcamp.

    <h4>
      What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will
      be?
    </h4>
    I already touched on this with the above about balancing life being a
    challenge but other than that, I think another non-technical challenge will
    be finding that motivation, dedication and discipline to keep up with the
    work. As long as I have someone to keep me accountable I think I can push
    through.

    <h4>
      What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed
      in yourself while at Dev Academy?
    </h4>
    I think developing leadership skills would be great like I mentioned in the
    first question. Also having more reflective skills would be great because I
    tend to just not think enough about things in life as a sort of coping
    mechanism to survive somehow.

    <h4>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h4>
    I think a supportive and helpful team would be great for Bootcamp. Someone
    who won't make me feel dumb/stupid when I don't know things and can simplify
    explanation down to a dummy level. It would be great to have encouraging
    messages along with help too, to help remind us that we are still beginners
    and will understand it more with time.

    <h4>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h4>
    I expect to spend more time doing the work and learning. I will continue to
    keep asking questions in Discord like I already do, I feel like not a lot of
    people really ask so far but I haven't been too afraid to ask even though no
    one else has. So my plan is to go to work until 12:30pm, have lunch, get
    started at 1:30pm monday- friday, having breaks in between until 5pm, have
    dinner, and study for a bit longer at night before sleeping so that it
    process in my mind during sleep. I will also try to spend a bit of time in
    the weekend as well to keep practicing everyday. Hopefully I can get all my
    questions out of the way before 5pm on the weekdays and have the rest of the
    time just working on my own.

    <h2>Foundations Learning Plan</h2>
    <h4>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h4>
    To be a successful manager either as a Project manager or an IT manager.
    <h4>
      A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
    </h4>
    My strength comes from my curiosity and perseverance when I am intrigued by
    something however my limitations come through when I’m not motivated,
    especially when I’m stuck in the rabbit hole of procrastination. However, as
    long as I am held accountable, I can continue pushing through.
    <h4>
      What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed
      in yourself while at Dev Academy?
    </h4>
    Perhaps the confidence to be able to speak up in a group or to lead a team
    would be a skill that I’d love to learn, given the opportunity.
    <h4>
      A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This
      should include: 1. An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work
      productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and
      industry/community representatives 2. What you will do when things are
      building up and starting to get to you
    </h4>
    I will manage my workload by sticking to a sustainable schedule that will
    keep me productive. I will be very commutative to my fellow learners,
    facilitators and industry/community representatives when work needs to be
    done and be open when I am struggling because communication is key to any
    relationship, especially collaborative ones. When things are getting to me,
    I will calmly clear my mind by taking a quick break away from the screen,
    get some fresh air and give it a go again. If I’m still struggling, I will
    ask for help.
    <h4>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h4>
    I already mentioned it above but I will step away from the problem first to
    clear my mind to get a fresh perspective on the problem and if that doesn’t
    work, I will ask if the discord help-desk for help and/or message my
    facilitator directly.
    <h4>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h4>
    A helpful team who is ready to come to our rescue when we need it (during
    working hours of course).
    <h4>
      Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed
      to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like
      school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
    </h4>
    I have work Monday-Friday at 8:30am-12:30pm as a part timer. This is
    actually important to keep my productivity rolling and also to pay for rent
    I guess.
