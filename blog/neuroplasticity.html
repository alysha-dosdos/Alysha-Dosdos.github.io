    <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
    <h4>
      Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits
      people.
    </h4>
    This opens up their mindset to be more open to change and adapt to harder
    challenges. This helps people realise that they are actually more capable
    than they thought about themselves. As long as they put in time effort and
    practice, they can achieve their goals by building a stronger neural
    connection in their brains as they do so.
    <h4>
      Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for
      your benefit.
    </h4>
    I will keep practicing and practicing until it gets hardwired in my brain.
    Revising what I learnt and also putting things into context will help me to
    learn and keep this information in the long run. Cramming will usually just
    make you lose your knowledge after some time but constantly revising will
    keep it in my mind for a long time. I have already started dreaming about
    the things I have learnt. It goes to show how much it is processing in my
    brain hahah.
    <h4>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h4>
    Practicing and putting in the time and effort as I mentioned will increase
    neuroplasticity. Revising concepts and seeing information again and within
    context will help build a stronger connection in the brain and
    neuroplastoity. Developing new and better habits and a better mindset will
    help rewire your brain to get rid of the bad ones and we can start changing
    to be better as long as we remain consistent with our actions.

    <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
    <h4>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</h4>
    Growth mindset is the way thinking towards any challenges in life. Having a
    growth mindset is being inspired by others’ success and not compare and put
    ourself down for it. Having a growth mindset is continuing to persevere is
    the face of hardship and not give up when it’s too hard. This is useful in
    this course because there will definitely be a lot of hardships coming our
    way and it is important to have that growth mindset to keep going and push
    through the challenges to achieve success.
    <h4>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h4>
    It made me realise how much of a fixed mindset I had this whole time and
    that is why I have not found much success in life. I thought I was just a
    failure as a person and it is what it is but it was actually myself who has
    been holding me back. My mindset was that I would put in as little effort
    into things and if it doesn’t work out well then at least I have en excuse
    of my failure because I thought I would rather have that than put in effort
    and still fail. But having a growth mindset means that failure is okay and I
    will try to keep practicing and do better next time.
    <h4>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h4>
    I will face any upcoming challenges and remind myself that I have -yet- to
    learn the content. I will eventually understand it and if I don’t yet, that
    is ok as long as I keep trying and don’t give up.I will learn from any
    criticisms I get and do better through that guidance. I will continue to put
    in effort no matter how unmotivated I am and find a way to complete the
    goal. I think having a “I’ll do it later” mindset is also bad so I should
    face that biggest challenge in my life and do it NOW.
