    <h3 class="middle">Problem solving</h3>
    <h4>A time where I was blocked on a simple problem:</h4>
    I was missing silly things like the return function. In the capitalize
    section of the built in methods in Kata, I thought we couldn't have 2 return
    functions because it would stop after the first one but it turns out in this
    situation, the first return was within the .map(). Eventually I did figure
    it out after I saw the working code and just worked backwards to figure out
    why it worked. I was feeling lost and overwhelmed during the whole process
    at first and may still feel that way now but at least now I learnt how
    .map() works and now know how functions and other built in methods work a
    bit better than before.
    <h4>A time where I elegantly solved a problem.</h4>
    I figured out what different functions I needed, layed it out step by step
    and slowly added all the things I need together and it worked. in the deBee
    section, I had to figure out how to remove the word buzz. By using the
    knowledge of .split(), i put that in first and made sure it was working with
    the help of the instructions. Then I looked up how to use filter and
    eventually figured out how to use it within my context and lastly I had to
    figure out how to ignore the capitalization. It was pretty straightforward
    and just had to use .toLowerCase in the right place. I felt excited to
    slowly unveil the answer and find my way somehow.
    <h4>
      Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving
      techniques/processes:
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Pseudocode- I think it is good to have just to put my initial thought of
        how I think it's going to work and then just slowly build on it. I just
        need to have my pseudocode
      </li>
      <li>
        Trying something- this is pretty much as the one above, just blindly
        testing to see if it works can eventually lead to the right solution but
        it just takes a lot of time with trial and error.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rubber ducky method- I'm confident I can use this as long as I know how
        each part of the code works but if I don't even know what I'm doing in
        the first place, then it is useless trying to explain. It does help me
        realize what each part is supposed to be doing and figuring out what
        knowledge I lack too.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reading error messages- It does have some useful hints but it makes it
        difficult when I don't know what I should be using instead. I just end
        up being lost not knowing how to fix it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Console.logging- this sometimes just straight up doesn't even work while
        I was doing Kata but I knew that when it doesn't come up with anything
        just means that it's probably undefined and I'm probably doing something
        wrong anyway. It is useful to figure out if each part of my code is
        working as intended.
      </li>
      <li>
        Googling- This was a bit difficult to use at first because I was
        overwhelmed with all the possible answers and didn't even know where to
        start. There were just too many to choose from and they were all in
        different context.
      </li>
      <li>
        Asking your peers for help- I was lucky to have a friend who was
        studying with me in the course we were both in the same boat and could
        help give each other hints on how to make things work. I'm also lucky to
        have friends in tech who already has experience in tech and can help out
        which is nice.
      </li>
      <li>
        Asking coaches for help- I always try to ask for help in discord first
        before I ask anyone else. The only problem is time because I have to
        make sure to ask before 5pm but sometimes I get work done after 5pm so
        there's no one free to ask in the facilitators.
      </li>
      <li>
        Improving your process with reflection- This is good to recap what I
        just learnt and to try and really understand why the code is working.
        The only problem I have so far is that I don't have as much time as I'd
        like to really delve deep into understanding each section.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
      Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made
      you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?
    </h4>
    I really wanted to figure it out myself first because I thought I would just
    get it eventually. I also felt a bit embarrassed wanting help on each
    section. It made me feel like I wasn't good enough on my own so it brought
    my confidence down. But, I just needed to remind myself to have a better,
    more forgiving mindset to myself and realize that I may not know it yet, but
    I know I will later as long as I put effort in and make sure to ask for the
    help as I need.
