    <h2>Taha Tinana (Physical Wellbeing)</h2>
    I will do high intensity training for at least 15 minutes everyday. I will
    also eat a more nutritional diet full of fruits and vegetables, vitamins,
    fibre and protein. I will also have a proper and consistent sleep schedule
    with at least 8 hours of sleep every night.

    <h2>Taha WhƒÅnau (Family Wellbeing)</h2>
    I will spend time with my parents every sunday for church and for lunch,
    meet with my boyfriend at least twice a week and catch up with a friend at
    least once a week. I will lend an ear to anyone who needs it so that they
    can also unload some burden in their lives and we can help each other.

    <h2>Taha Hinengaro (Emotional and Mental Wellbeing)</h2>
    I will spend at least an hour a day away from social media and mindless
    distractions, this can be spent doing the yoga/meditation, other hobbies or
    with people. I will ask for help when I need it and talk to someone about my
    feelings in life. I won't bottle up my emotions anymore and communicate with
    everyone.

    <h2>Taha Wairua (Spiritual Wellbeing)</h2>
    I will do yoga/meditation after work, before I start working on the sprint.
    I will stop and practice appreciation and gratefulness every morning and
    reflect at night. I will also pray at church for my family and friends, my
    continued motivations in life and future success for everyone.

    <h2>Whenua (Interconnections to the land and environment)</h2>
    I will go for a hike at least once a week and go for a walk by the ocean to
    appreciate nature's beauty in the mountains and the sea. I will try to
    appreciate the little things in nature such as the breeze, the sunlight
    against my skin and the clouds above. I'll try to look at some greenery
    where I can and maybe try to raise a plant.
