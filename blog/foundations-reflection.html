    <h4>
      What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due
      to the Human Skills learning?
    </h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Listening- I found out I might not be as good as listening as I first
        thought but I've become more self aware since and became better
      </li>
      <li>
        Consistency- Discipline is hard but I've somehow manage to drag myself
        to my laptop and actually get coding. Not fully sure about where my
        source of motivation comes from but I've managed to survive.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mindset- It is a bit difficult to change my mindset overnight but I'm
        slowly making my way to a better, more forgiving mindset
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h4>
      What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
      programming?
    </h4>
    Values make you see the whole picture in life and help realize that it is
    possible to learn with the mindset of 'yet'. Empathy can help you see how
    the code works and how the person who made it can make it useful so that we
    can work on it. Self-awareness is being able to code nicely so that anyone
    who sees our code can work on it easily and understand what you want.

    <h4>What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?</h4>
    I don't think there was anything in particular the surprised me since I
    studied psychology in uni so I've already sort of known most things that was
    taught. But it was interesting to see how it relates to programming and
    working with others in tech.

    <h4>
      What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?
    </h4>
    It was all the reflections and having to really think and dig deep into my
    mind and thought that felt a bit emotionally uncomfortable at times maybe
    because I'm not used to thinking that much about myself lol.

    <h4>
      Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
      focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
    </h4>
    I think it is important and necessary skill to have to be able to work as a
    team in the working environment because most of the time, with programming,
    you have to deal with other people and communicate with their needs and how
    you can work together to efficiently get to the same goal together.

    <h4>
      Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a
      waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practice programming
      instead? Justify your answer.
    </h4>
    I don't think it was a waste of time but I do admittedly tend to rush
    through them. I think it helps you see the world as a whole instead of just
    focusing on one aspect of life which is just the programming part. In the
    world of programming and computers, what separates us is our ability to
    think for ourselves and reflect on our feelings. We need to be reminded that
    there is more to life than just being able to code well. We also need to
    understand ourselves and others to work together and become better.
