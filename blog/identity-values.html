    I was told a secret that affects another friend at school but I ended up
    telling her because I thought that I would’ve want to know if I was on her
    shoes. It ended becoming a bigger deal because she brought it up to her mum
    who brought it up to the dean. I still think that it was better that I told
    her
    <h4>
      Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
      values and identity.

      <li>
        Growing up to be the only child has led me to be quite spoilt and always
        given everything without me having to ask but as a shy kid, I didn’t
        really ask for much (mostly probably because I already had it)
      </li>
      <li>
        Being part of the filipino community has taught me to be respectful to
        other people and self aware when It comes to self image.
      </li>
      <li>
        Being part of a catholic youth group has taught me a sense of
        friendship, faith and confidence. It has taught me to be a leader and
        has brought out my other talents such as singing.
      </li>
      <li>
        Working has taught me to be efficient with doing things in the best
        possible way so I that I could finish earlier and still feel like I’m
        getting paid to do nothing.

      Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning

    <ul>
      <li>
        I am persistent when it comes to things I care about which will help me
        continue studying even when things get hard.
      </li>
      <li>
        I am quite curious- once something piques my interest, I always early
        try to learn more
      </li>
      <li>
        Efficient- I always try to make sure that I’m saving time by doing
        things the best and quickest way possible- this could be helpful when
        coding
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
      Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
      development. How might these affect your learning journey?
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I can be quite dependent on other people keeping me accountable. I can
        work really well when other people’s grades are on the line but when it
        comes to working for myself, I sometime might not stay motivated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Might not be the most consistent when it comes to being diligent. This
        could hold me back when I’m not feeling the best but as long as I have
        supportive people around me, I can persevere.
      </li>
    </ul>

    I was once working with two other girls for market day at school but they
    both tend to disagree and argue often however I would be the middle man who
    explained what the other was trying to say so they can understand each
    other’s perspectives. This communication was important to effectively work
    as a team and also compromise.
