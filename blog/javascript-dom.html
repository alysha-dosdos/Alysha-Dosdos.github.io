    <h3 class="middle">JavaScript and DOM</h3>
    <h4>
      An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.
    </h4>
    JavaScript is like the puppet master or the maestro of HTML and CSS. It
    allows the audience/the viewer to interact with the show. Let's use the
    Greatest Showman as an example. HTML is the builder who created the circus
    tent and introduced the content of the show- the actors and performers while
    CSS is the costume designer and the one who decides how the whole show is
    gonna look. It is JavaScript who orchestrates for the whole show to come
    together and make an amazing entertainment for the guests to watch and
    interact with. JavaScript is the Greatest Showman.
    <h4>
      Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday
      life, for example, 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth' (but not those).
    </h4>
    Control flow is the order in which the processes are done and loops are for
    repeating the same action but with a different value. An example of this in
    everyday life is like when you're eating a meal. The order of actions you
    take to eat a meal is to first pick up the spoon and fork, then you scoop
    and push some food onto the spoon with the fork, then you lift the spoon
    into your mouth and chew. That is like the control flow. The loop is when
    you repeat that action but each time you get a different bite of food,
    having different combinations of food and flavour. This keeps happening
    until there is no more food left to eat. In code, this would look like
    for(let i = 0; i less than food.length; i++). This is basically saying that
    the loop starts at 0, when nothing has happened yet and it keeps going until
    the amount of food is gone. The i++ just means that the amount of times the
    loop has occurred (i) will just increase by 1.
    <h4>
      Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.
    </h4>
    The DOM is like the structure to a programme. It shows how something is
    linked to another and what their relationship is to each other like in a
    family tree, how there are parents, children and siblings. We can use
    JavaScript to interact with the DOM to change things in HTML or CSS. We can
    access and use the different 'objects' in the DOM by adding a dot (.) in
    between. For example, if we wanted to use the h1 element in the photo below,
    we can put document.html.body.h1. So we go down the tree, starting from the
    great grand parent (document), the grant parent (html), the parent (body)
    and the child (h1). We can also see their sibling (a) in the family tree. In
    reality, we actually just use a querySelector() to find what we want easily.

    <h4>
      Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
    </h4>

    answer
    <h4>Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Functions are like an instruction manual to show you how to build a
        table for example. It has all the items you need to build like the wood,
        the nails and it tells you how to put those items together, the way it
        is supposed to be and how it's supposed to look like.
      </li>
      <li>
        When we define a function, we are like making the instruction manual for
        the computer and when we call a function, we are telling the computer to
        use the manual to actually build the table.
      </li>
      <li>
        This is important because we need the computer to know what to do which
        is why a function is helpful to have in your code.
