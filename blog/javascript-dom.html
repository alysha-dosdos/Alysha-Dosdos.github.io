    <h3 class="middle">JavaScript and DOM</h3>
    <h4>
      An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.
    </h4>
    JavaScript is like the puppet master or the maestro of HTML and CSS. It
    allows the audience/the viewer to interact with the show. Let's use the
    Greatest Showman as an example. HTML is the builder who created the circus
    tent and introduced the content of the show- the actors and performers while
    CSS is the costume designer and the one who decides how the whole show is
    gonna look. It is JavaScript who orchestrates for the whole show to come
    together and make an amazing entertainment for the guests to watch and
    interact with. JavaScript is the Greatest Showman.

      life, for example, 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth' (but not those).

    answer
    <h4>Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Functions are like an instruction manual to show you how to build a
        table for example. It has all the items you need to build like the wood,
        the nails and it tells you how to put those items together, the way it
        is supposed to be and how it's supposed to look like.
      </li>
      <li>
        When we define a function, we are like making the instruction manual for
        the computer and when we call a function, we are telling the computer to
        use the manual to actually build the table.
      </li>
      <li>
        This is important because we need the computer to know what to do which
        is why a function is helpful to have in your code.
