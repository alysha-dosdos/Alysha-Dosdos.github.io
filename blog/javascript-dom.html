    <ul>
      <li>
        Functions are like an instruction manual to show you how to build a
        table for example. It has all the items you need to build like the wood,
        the nails and it tells you how to put those items together, the way it
        is supposed to be and how it's supposed to look like.
      </li>
      <li>
        When we define a function, we are like making the instruction manual for
        the computer and when we call a function, we are telling the computer to
        use the manual to actually build the table.
      </li>
      <li>
        This is important because we need the computer to know what to do which
        is why a function is helpful to have in your code.
